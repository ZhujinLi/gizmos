This is an attempt to optimize a program with AVX2.

The result is rather surprising to me: the compiler did even a better job than my hand-written SIMD intrinsics.

Here is the result on my Macbook Pro:

===Plain version===
Elapsed time: 0.521067s
===Plain version with O3===
Elapsed time: 0.136172s
===SIMD version with O3===
Elapsed time: 0.240057s

I can't explain it unless digging into assembly code...
